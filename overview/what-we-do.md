# ðŸ’¡ What we do

## **Key Components**:

1\. **ERC404 Tokenized NFTs Standard**:

* **New Standard**: ERC404 tokenizes NFTs, offering fractional ownership, where 1 NFT is equal to **10^8** tokens.
* **Mechanism**:
  * Users accumulate tokens, and once they reach **10^8**, they can mint a randomized NFT.
  * If users do not reach **10^8** tokens, a portion of the tokens will be randomly burned, adding an element of risk and scarcity.
* **Liquidity and Transaction Benefits**:
  * **Boosts Chain Volume**: Tokenized NFTs solve the liquidity problem of traditional NFTs, allowing users to trade fractional tokens with much higher liquidity, resulting in increased transaction volume and more user engagement.
  * **Higher User Activity**: The increased liquidity of tokens attracts a wider range of users, promoting higher activity on the Aptos chain, boosting both the user base and transaction throughput.

2\. **Bonding Curve Launchpad**:

* **Market-Driven Fundraising**: The X404 PUMP launchpad allows creators to raise funds using a bonding curve model, inspired by platforms like pump.fun.
* **Dynamic Token Pricing**: Creators set an initial price, and as tokens are purchased, their price increases along the bonding curve, making the sale adaptable to market demand.
* **Trend Creation**: Popular collections that experience a "pump" can trigger trends within the ecosystem, boosting visibility and sales for viral projects.
* **Liquidity Guarantee**: Once 50% of a collection is sold, its tokens will automatically be added to the DEX liquidity pool, enabling active trading.
* **Market Adaptability**: The bonding curve helps collections match market demand, allowing creators to maximize profits as interest grows and token prices rise.

3\. **Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and NFT Marketplace**:

* **Self-Sustaining Ecosystem**: X404 PUMP includes both a DEX for token trading and an NFT marketplace, creating a self-contained environment where liquidity flows seamlessly.
* **New AMM Mechanism**: The platform introduces a unique Automated Market Maker (AMM) designed for the Aptos ecosystem, ensuring smooth liquidity management for tokenized NFTs and increasing trading efficiency.
* **Liquidity Boost**: By tokenizing NFTs and trading them on the DEX, the ecosystem ensures greater liquidity and a faster turnover of assets compared to traditional NFT platforms.
* **Continuous Money Flow**: Hosting the DEX and marketplace within the ecosystem ensures a constant flow of assets and liquidity, enabling the platform to operate autonomously and sustainably.
